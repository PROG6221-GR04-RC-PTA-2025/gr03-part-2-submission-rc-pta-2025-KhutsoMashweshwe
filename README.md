ECHO - My Cybersecurity Chatbot
what is this?
This is a console chatbot I made in C#. It’s called ECHO (which stands for Educational Cybersecurity Helper & Consultant). It's like a lil buddy that talks to you about cybersecurity stuff and gives tips when you ask it questions.

why i made it?
I made this for my programming class and also cause I think cybersecurity is important and people (even me) forget simple things like strong passwords or not clicking shady links lol.

what it does
Welcomes you with a cool ascii logo and sound
Asks for your name and remembers what topics you’re interested in
You type something like “how do I make a strong password?” and it gives you help
It can tell if you sound worried, confused or curious
No menu. Just chat like a real convasation
Remembers your interests if you say “remember” or “remind”

topics it knows
Passwords
Phishing
Privacy
Malware
Firewalls
MFA (multi-factor login stuff)

how to use it
Open in Visual Studio or VS Code (I use VS Code tbh)
Make sure you have .NET 8 or newer
Put a greeting.wav file if you want sound (or it will just skip)
Run it.

Type anything like:
"how do I protect my data?"
"I'm scared of hackers"
"remind me what I asked before"

Type exit to close it

things I used
C# (.NET 8)
Console app
System.Media for sound
Some lists and dictionaries for storing topics
known bugs / things I didn’t do yet
Doesn’t use AI, it just checks for words
Could crash if the sound file is missing but I handled it
Doesn’t save your interests after you close it (no file saving)
